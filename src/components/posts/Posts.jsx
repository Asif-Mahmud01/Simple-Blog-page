      <Post h='Overview of The Problem:'
       p='The fact that our designer goods do not represent wealth for positive utility
        is having more negative damage to society than we can fathom. This article is 
        going to help detail why, and detail our solution in progress.  As individuals, 
        once we cover our basic needs, status becomes an intrinsic motivator in the rest 
        of our actions. Status comes in many forms. The healthiest / most enlightened 
        cultures put the highest status in rewarding positive sum behavior. '

      <Post h='A Deeper Dive:' p='On a fundamental level once someone gets the basics covered as in food, water, shelter. They can start to spend their time and money on convenience, health, and purpose but more often than not; status is where a majority of surplus wealth goes. 
 
 Societally we lack an alignment of our status symbols with creating a better world and with bettering ourselves. This idea to change what we cultural see as status has been referred to as “Status Engineering”. 
  
 What we wear is the most direct way we have to represent ourselves and our ideals/values. What your role model wears, or any person of influence is shaping the idea of status in that child, teenager, or adults mind.

      <Post h='The Simple Solution' p='Thought experiments make it obvious that this idea is memetic, and just has not been tried in the market. Once one initial company opens up this model, many more will follow and copy:
For the same price as a Louie Vuitton bag, a permanent shelter can be built in Bangladesh for a family in need. This gives rise to the idea that anytime someone walks into a designer store and purchased an item, they are having to burn down a house (most making this decision unknowingly).

      <Post h='Large Scale Cultural Engineering ' p='Ultimately, the more projects that promote this new line of thinking, the more people think others think this way, the more status will align culturally with its true nature. Watching others do good for the world has always given us more hope for humanity.  We believe the flippening of status has the potential to solve the worlds greatest cause of poverty, the failed distribution of wealth worldwide.' img="https://images.pexels.com/photos/5490778/pexels-photo-5490778.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&w=500"/>
      <Post h='Bringing The Inevitable Future Forward' p='There’s a vibe shift underway, as we get closer and closer to a post scarcity economy, the eternal currency of the future of good karma will become more clear. 
For the greedy who still wish to hold on to ownership of something land is going to skyrocket as an asset, ownership on plots of earth will be seen as one of the steadiest investments as we approach a hyper decrease in the cost of building.
